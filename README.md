# Project Name : Redactr

## Project function

This app is to help people safely share content on social media by scrambling portions of the text they don't want the world to read/see. A user will write/paste some content into a form field and then specify the words they need to be scambled (using another field). Note the user is allowed to specify more than one word (seperated by space) to be scambled.
